# The Type 20 is broken

The Type 20 weapon in Roblox's Phantom Forces is awesome! It has very good penetration and all around good damage for an Assault Rifle.

It has a firerate of 650 RPM and is unlocked at Rank 37! Which makes the gun a fantastic use at very low ranks. This gun is very broken at it's current state as it allows you to infinitely 4-tap torso all ranges! :eyes: The gun is very impressive which is why I wanted to do a blog post.
